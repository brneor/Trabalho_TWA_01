            <h2>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
            <p>On any keyboard, the user taps a letter that actuates, or register, and tells the device to send a signal to the computer. When the key is on for a fraction of second, it sends a single letter to the computer; when it's on for longer, it sends the letter over and over.</p>

            <h3>Membrane keys</h3>
            <p>On membrane keyboards, the key passes through a plastic layer with electrical contacts and then though a hone to a second layer that interrupts a circuit to register the stroke. Pressing through these layers makes typing on a membrane feel like tapping your fingers on old, stale Jell-O.</p>

            <p>For purposes of this article, consider "chiclets" keyboards, such as those used by Apple desktop computers, to work identically to regular membrane models. It's not strictly true, but the technology is similar enough that the same considerations apply when comparing them to mechanical devices.</p>

            <h3>Mechanical switches</h3>
            <p>When you type on a mechanical keyboard, you press down on a keycap, which activates a spring-loaded switch underneath it. Depending on the type of switch, this spring can require more or less force and it can either make a pleasant "clack" noise or remain silent. In every case, mechanical switches provide tactile feedback, which helps typists know that they have pressed the key hard enough to register and haven't missed a letter. Unlike membrane keys, mechanical switches don't have to be pressed down the entire way to actuate so users can avoid the unpleasant feeling of "bottoming out" (pressing against the base) at full force.</p>

            <p>This may sound like mechanical keyboards require much more force to actuate than their membrane counterparts, but that's not the case. ZF Electronics, which produces the Cherry MX line of switches, has a variety of them available. Some switches, such as the Blues and Greens, do indeed recall the clackety typewriters of yore, but others, such as the Reds, are almost silent and require no heavier a touch than the membrane keyboards in your office or school computer lab.</p>

            <h2>So... why mechanical?</h2>
            <p>Mechanical keyboards are not new in the world of computer peripherals. They're around almost as long as computers itself. They've prove to be reliable and durable and easily repairable.</p>

            <p>If you're a touch typist, getting a mechanical keyboard will increase your speed and accuracy. As users type more quickly, the chance of an understroke increases. By providing strong physical and, in the case of clicky switches, auditory feedback on every actuation, mechanical keyboards allow you to adjust your strokes and generate the highest possible number of words per minute. You won't get the same experience pushing against two pieces of plastic.</p>

            <h2>What about customization?</h2>
            <p>As mechanical keyboards are composed by so many parts and those parts have so many variations, of course people started messing around and started building their own custom mechanical keyboard.</p>

            <p>Why? Well, they look really nice :)</p>
